aS"The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's"
p1561
aS'poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern'
p1562
aS'artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the'
p1563
aS'qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest'
p1564
aS'themes,--life and love and death. That "irresistible needle-touch,"'
p1565
aS'as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very'
p1566
aS'core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as'
p1567
aS'it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling'
p1568
aS'power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to'
p1569
aS'form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.'
p1570
ag2
aS'Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending'
p1571
aS'occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of'
p1572
aS'her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H."'
p1573
aS'must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th'
p1574
aS'September, 1884, she wrote:--'
p1575
ag2
ag2
aS'MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses'
p1576
aS'you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and'
p1577
aS'generation" that you will not give them light.'
p1578
ag2
aS'If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive'
p1579
aS'you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee'
p1580
aS'and executor. Surely after you are what is called'
p1581
aS'"dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you'
p1582
aS'have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your'
p1583
aS'verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think'
p1584
aS'we have a right to withhold from the world a word or'
p1585
aS'a thought any more than a deed which might help a'
p1586
aS'single soul. . . .'
p1587
ag2
aS'                Truly yours,'
p1588
ag2
ag2
ag2
aS'The "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson\'s death,'
p1589
aS'by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had'
p1590
aS'been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little'
p1591
aS'fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear'
p1592
aS'evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had'
p1593
aS'received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of'
p1594
aS'rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and'
p1595
aS'phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one'
p1596
aS'form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without'
p1597
aS'important exception, her friends have generously placed at the'
p1598
aS'disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and'
p1599
aS'these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several'
p1600
aS'renderings of the same verse.'
p1601
ag2
aS'To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been'
p1602
aS'subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They'
p1603
aS'should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and'
p1604
aS'suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some'
p1605
aS'time in the finished picture.'
p1606
ag2
aS'Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the'
p1607
aS'winter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the'
p1608
aS'April following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until'
p1609
aS'this winter."'
p1610
ag2
aS'The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running'
p1611
aS'Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in'
p1612
aS'breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her'
p1613
aS'latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its'
p1614
aS'fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,'
p1615
aS'everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous'
p1616
aS'dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of'
p1617
aS'a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and'
p1618
aS'strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of'
p1619
aS'the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,'
p1620
aS'the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general'
p1621
aS'chronologic accuracy.'
p1622
ag2
aS'As a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial,"'
p1623
aS'"A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named'
p1624
aS'by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the'
p1625
aS'accompanying note, if sent to a friend.'
p1626
ag2
aS'The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in'
p1627
aS'pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of'
p1628
aS'responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not'
p1629
aS'absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her'
p1630
aS'rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it'
p1631
aS'seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and'
p1632
aS'more usual rhymes.'
p1633
ag2
aS"Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very"
p1634
aS'absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily'
p1635
aS"Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a"
p1636
aS'particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything'
p1637
aS'virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of'
p1638
aS'inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and'
p1639
aS'the "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an'
p1640
aS'unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.'
p1641
ag2
aS'Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.'
p1642
aS'Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the'
p1643
aS'sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She'
p1644
aS'touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost'
p1645
aS'humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is'
p1646
aS'never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic'
p1647
aS'has said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession,"'
p1648
aS'it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced'
p1649
aS'as it is rare.'
p1650
ag2
aS'She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She'
p1651
aS'was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no'
p1652
aS'love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature'
p1653
aS'introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist'
p1654
aS'in pretence.'
p1655
ag2
aS'Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and'
p1656
aS'bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted'
p1657
aS'human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the'
p1658
aS'first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of'
p1659
aS'pope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an'
p1660
aS'epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or'
p1661
aS'melancholy, she lived in its presence.'

aS'Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in'

aS'exceptionally strong ones, as "A Book," and "With Flowers."'
p4140

aS'There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply'
p4141
aS'spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward'

p4143
aS'for example, the verses "I had a Guinea golden," which seem to'
p4144
aS'have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty'
p4145
aS'reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in'
p4146
aS"which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been"
p4147
aS'written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the'
